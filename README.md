# Friend-Finder

## Description
This is a Friend Finder app with characters from Rick and Morty.  The user will press the "Go thru Portal" button that will navigate to the survey.  The user will then answer ten questions.  Based on the total of all the answers, a modal will show displaying a character from Rick and Morty.  The user's name, link to photo, and answers will then be saved in an array and added to an object found in the API Friends List.  There's also a link to my Friend Finder GitHub page next to the API Friends List.
